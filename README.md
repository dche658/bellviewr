Indirect reference intervals using R

This R shiny app has been designed as a tool to assist in the process
for developing reference intervals using and indirect approach based
on data mining. At the present time the application supports the 
use of Bhattaharya analysis. As well as the refineR algorithm.

Bhattacharya analysis is based on the implementation by 
Dr. Daniel T. Holmes, MD and Dr. Kevin A Buhr, PhD.
