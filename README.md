Indirect reference intervals using R

This R shiny app has been designed as a tool to assist in the process
for developing reference intervals using and indirect approach based
on data mining. At the present time the application supports the 
use of Bhattaharya analysis. As well as the refineR algorithm as implemented
in the as named package and described in Ammer T., Schuetzenmeister A., 
Prokosch H.-U., Rauh M., Rank C.M., Zierk J. "refineR: A Novel Algorithm for 
Reference Interval Estimation from Real-World Data". Scientific Reports (2021)
<doi:10.1038/s41598-021-95301-2>.

Bhattacharya analysis is based on the implementation described in

the Hoffmann Method, the Correct Approach, and Modern Alternatives, American
